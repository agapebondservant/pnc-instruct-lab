Background

Given the highly regulated environment in which PNC and other FSI customers operate, it is important for employees to be aware of, seek to comply with, and never intentionally violate, relevant laws and regulations. Financial institutions like PNC are investing in AI solutions that act as an assistant for knowledge aggregation and searching. In pre-production, PNC reported  that they are exploring use cases for front line employees and branch employees look through thousands of pages of documents in their support for clients.

The PNC Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is one such document that PNC employees need to utilize frequently to provide the ethical guidelines and expectations for conducting business on behalf of PNC. The document contains a lot of general knowledge on PNC products, policies, and even Q&amp;A for conducting business with PNC.

Additionally, Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a set of security requirements established by major credit card companies to protect cardholder data and reduce credit card fraud. Administered by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council, PCI DSS applies to all entities that process, store, or transmit credit card information. Compliance involves adhering to twelve specific requirements, such as maintaining secure networks, protecting stored cardholder data, and implementing strong access control measures. â€‹

For PNC employees, awareness and implementation of PCI DSS are crucial to ensure the security of customer payment information, maintain trust, and avoid potential penalties associated with non-compliance.

Use Case Justification: Implementing a GenAI POC at PNC, utilizing a LLM trained on internal documents, can significantly enhance employee knowledge management. By processing a large amount of information on products, services, regulations, and customer service policies, the LLM can transform unstructured data into a searchable, coherent knowledge base. This advancement streamlines information retrieval, enabling employees to access accurate and up-to-date content efficiently, thereby improving decision-making and customer interactions. Moreover, integrating AI into training programs can personalize learning experiences, accelerating skill acquisition and ensuring compliance with industry standards. This approach not only boosts productivity but also fosters a culture of continuous learning and adaptability within the organization.

Goal of POC: Convey how an LLM trained on PNC documents that contain information on products, services, regulations, and customer service policies can generate more searchable knowledge for employee awareness and training.
